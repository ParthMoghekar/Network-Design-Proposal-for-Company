# Network-Design-Proposal-for-Company

The users of the network will be the 500 employees of Company. This is intended to be an
internal network accessible only by employees, not customers. The users
will require access from three different geographic locations: 1) the Headquarters Office 2) the
Production and Warehouse facility and 3) the Sales Office.
Network requirement
1. Network Topology diagram.
2. Identify the hardware required like routers, switches, access points (Cisco)
3. The network has to be segregated into different locations
4. TCP/IP Network design and IP address table.
5. Configurations and features which are required to be configured on the devices


ABSTRACT
This report describes Network Design for a Company. In this network topology the nodes (i.e., computers, switches, routers or other devices) are connected to a local area network (LAN) and network via links (twisted pair copper wire cable or optical fibre cable). We have used Cisco Packet Tracer for designing the network topology Itâ€™s a general design which can be implemented at any higher level to manage network system.
A network consists of three main components- the clients, servers, and circuits. The clients are the devices at the user end. The servers store data and/or software that the user can access, and the circuit is the system of connections between components of the network. The circuit provides the pathway through which signals travel, and can be comprised of both wired and wireless connections. In the case of the network design for the Company, for different jobs computers, cell phones, laptops, printers and tablets and connected. The servers store data, and are found in each of the LANs at the three sites.
